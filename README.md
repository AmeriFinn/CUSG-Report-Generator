Within this repository is a macro-enabled workbook I wrote in order to automate the process of creating financial reports for CU Student Government.

The current version is able to create quarterly reports, seasonal budgets, and annual budgets for 12 different offices and hundreds of accounts. Reports are created by collecting the raw data from .csv files and aggregating that into the desired template. The resulting reports can be exported and distributed into new workbooks without the generator modules. For annual budget reports, a word document is also created with various pieces of data being copy and pasted into a budget narrative template. 

In addition to the generator program, there are example .csv files that can be used to run the generator and get a demonstration of what the generator does.

Simple instructions are included in the generator workbook and it is designed to be a very easy-to-use application.

Overall, this program I have written has been able to bring down the lead time for creating these reports from upwards of one week, down to just 15-30 minutes.
