# VBA-Projects
Within this repository is a macro-enabled workbook I created in order to automate the process of creating financial reports for CU Student Government.
In addition to the generator program, there are example .csv files that can be used to run the generator and get a demonstration of what the generator does.
There are also example output files for the Seasonal Budget reports to demonstrate the delivarables the generator creates. 

Simple instructions are included in the generator workbook and it is designed to be a very easy-to-use application.

Overall, this program I have written has been able to bring down the lead time for creating these reports from upwards of one week, down to just 15-30 minutes.
